## Project Overview
This project aims to get insight from the SkillHarvest Cohort 2 Interns Data collated with google form during one of our class session, to gather insights into the demographics and interests of the interns participating in the program.

## Data Sources
Data was collected through survey conducted via Google Form, capturing information such as name, email address, age group, occupation, state of residence, gender, and highest level of education. The objective is to provide valuable insights for program improvement and participant engagement strategies.

## Tools Used
- Google Form
- Google Sheet
- Power Bi
- Power Query Editor

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Data cleaning process:

- Used first row as headers: Ensured that the first row of the dataset is treated as column headers for easier data manipulation.

- Changed data type: Converted columns to appropriate data types to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

- Removed duplicate records associated with "Jonathan Foliu Klu" in the Names column: Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

- Trimmed leading and trailing spaces: Remove extra spaces from strings to ensure consistency and avoid errors.

- Converted email columns to lowercase for consistency

- Changed names to proper case in the Names column: Standardized the capitalization of names for readability and consistency.

- Replace specific occupation values with standardized terms:

  - Replaced "NYSS" with "Corps Member".
  - Replaced "Corper" with "Corps Member".
  - Replaced "Education officer 2" with "Tutor".
  - Replaced "Teacher" with "Tutor".
  - Replaced "Learner" with "Student".
  - Replaced "Customer Service Rep" with "Customer Success Associate".
  - Standardized all variations of engineering occupations to simply "Engineering".
  - Capitalized each word in occupation: Standardize the capitalization of occupation titles for consistency.

- Replaced null value of "Mujeeb" in the country column with "Nigeria": Fill null values with appropriate default values to ensure completeness and accuracy in the dataset.

By following these steps, the data has been cleaned and standardized for further analysis
