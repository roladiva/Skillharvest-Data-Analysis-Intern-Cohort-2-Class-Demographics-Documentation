## Project Overview
This project aims to get insight from the SkillHarvest Cohort 2 Interns Data collated with google form during one of our class session, to gather insights into the demographics and interests of the interns participating in the program.

## Data Sources
Data was collected through survey conducted via Google Form, capturing information such as name, email address, age group, occupation, state of residence, gender, and highest level of education. The objective is to provide valuable insights for program improvement and participant engagement strategies.

## Tools Used
- Google Form
- Google Sheet
- Power Bi
- Power Query Editor

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Data cleaning process:

- Used first row as headers: Ensured that the first row of the dataset is treated as column headers for easier data manipulation.

- Changed data type: Converted columns to appropriate data types to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

- Removed duplicate records associated with "Jonathan Foliu Klu" in the Names column: Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

- Trimmed leading and trailing spaces: Remove extra spaces from strings to ensure consistency and avoid errors.

- Converted email columns to lowercase for consistency

- Changed names to proper case in the Names column: Standardized the capitalization of names for readability and consistency.

- Replace specific occupation values with standardized terms:

  - Replaced "NYSS" with "Corps Member".
  - Replaced "Corper" with "Corps Member".
  - Replaced "Education officer 2" with "Tutor".
  - Replaced "Teacher" with "Tutor".
  - Replaced "Learner" with "Student".
  - Replaced "Customer Service Rep" with "Customer Success Associate".
  - Standardized all variations of engineering occupations to simply "Engineering".
  - Capitalized each word in occupation: Standardize the capitalization of occupation titles for consistency.

- Replaced null value of "Mujeeb" in the country column with "Nigeria": Fill null values with appropriate default values to ensure completeness and accuracy in the dataset.


## Results and Findings
- Age Group Representation:
  - The majority of interns fall within the age group of 25-29, indicating a significant proportion of interns in this demographic.
- Academic Qualification Distribution:
  - Interns with HND/BSC/BTech qualifications are predominant in the dataset, suggesting a higher participation rate among individuals with these academic backgrounds.
  - Conversely, individuals with ND and SSCE qualifications are notably underrepresented among the participants.
- Geographic Distribution:
A notable observation is that the majority of interns are from Nigeria, indicating a higher proportion of Nigerians within the age range of 25-29 participating in internship programs compared to other regions.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
- Diversification of Internship Outreach:
  - To ensure a broader representation across age groups, SkillHarvest should consider diversifying outreach strategies to attract interns from a wider range of demographics.
  - Targeting younger age groups, such as individuals below 25, could help tap into potential talent pools that may be currently underrepresented.
    
- Engagement with Non-Degree Holders:
  - SkillHarvest should implement initiatives to engage individuals with ND and SSCE qualifications, such as tailored internship programs or skill development workshops.
  - Providing opportunities for these individuals to gain experience and skills could enhance diversity and inclusion within the internship program.
    
- Enhanced Regional Engagement:
  - While the majority of interns are from Nigeria, SkillHarvest should explore strategies to attract interns from other regions.
  - Collaborations with educational institutions, industry partners, and professional networks in other countries or regions could help expand the geographical diversity of internship participants.
- Conclusion:
The analysis of intern demographics highlights both strengths and areas for improvement in the internship program. While there is a significant representation of interns in the age group of 25-29 and a predominant presence of individuals with HND/BSC/BTech qualifications, there is room for enhancing diversity across age groups, academic qualifications, and geographic regions.

By implementing targeted outreach strategies, engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds, and expanding regional partnerships, the internship program can achieve greater inclusivity and foster a more diverse talent pipeline. This not only enriches the learning experience for interns but also contributes to the overall success and effectiveness of the program.
